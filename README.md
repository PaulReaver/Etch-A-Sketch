# Etch A Sketch
A digital Etch A Sketch that allows users to draw by interacting directly with the screen. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

## Motivation
This project was made to:
- Improve my DOM manipulation skills.
- Gain proficiency in applying CSS and JavaScript methods in dynamic and non-structured environments.

## Quick Start
Publicly available at the following link: https://paulreaver.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/

## Usage
Draw on the board by hovering over the pixel grid. When you're done, clear the grid with the top button or change its size with the Change grid size button. For a fun twist, select the rainbow button to add a random color to each cell.
